# final-game-MoistyDev
It's a first year final project for the Object-Oriented Programming II class from my college.
It's a round-based topdown shooter heavily inspired by COD Zombies, all made with a custom Java game engine.
Assets are gotten from the Web for the character and the enemies.
For the decor, it's a mix of assets gotten from the internet and from the popular topdown game called Hotline Miami.
Made only for educational purposes.
